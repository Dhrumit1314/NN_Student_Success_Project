# Academic Performance Prediction Project - Neural Network

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of students successfully passing a course based on their first-year academic performance. The system collects input data from users, specifically input fields related to their performance in the initial year. A predictive model is then employed to analyze this information and generate an output indicating the probability of course success.

## Features
- Collects user input data on first-year academic performance.
- Utilizes a predictive model to analyze input information.
- Generates an output predicting the likelihood of successful course completion.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow 2.x
- Flask
- numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies

## Usage
1. Run the main script: `python app.py`.
2. Input relevant parameters when prompted.
3. View the prediction results.

## Input Data
- User input data related to first-year academic performance is required.

## Model Training
- Details on model training can be found in the 'Model' directory.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature_branch`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add new feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature_branch`.
